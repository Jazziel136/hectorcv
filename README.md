# My CV - Portfolio

This is my CV, but not in the traditional sense. It’s a dynamic **portfolio** created using HTML to showcase my **work experience**, **skills**, and **knowledge** in more detail. 

Unlike a traditional resume, this version includes:
- **Detailed descriptions of my work experience** and professional background.
- A showcase of my **diplomas**, **degrees**, and **certificates**.
- **Relevant photos** from my work experiences.
- **Images of awards and recognition** I’ve received for achievements.

This portfolio aims to present a more comprehensive and visual representation of my career, making it easier for you to see the impact I’ve made and the milestones I’ve reached.
